## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**

### **Recommended Approach: Side-by-Side Deployment**

#### Phase 1: Deploy New Version (20 minutes)
1. **Create Repository**: `kroi-auto-center-clean` on GitHub
2. **Deploy New Service**: Parallel deployment for testing
3. **Validate Performance**: Compare against current version
4. **A/B Testing**: Traffic comparison

#### Phase 2: Optimization & Migration (30 minutes)
1. **Performance Validation**: Ensure <1.5s response times
2. **Content Migration**: Transfer content to Sanity CMS
3. **DNS/Traffic Switch**: Gradual migration from old to new
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Comprehensive dashboard for all projects

### **Alternative: Direct Replacement**
- Update existing service with new codebase
- Faster deployment but less testing opportunity
